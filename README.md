[Franz Martin Hilgendorf](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Martin_Hilgendorf) _(5 December 1839 â€“ 5 July 1904) was a German zoologist and paleontologist. Hilgendorf's research on fossil snails from the Steinheim crater in the early 1860s became a palaeontological evidence for the theory of evolution published by Charles Darwin in 1859._
